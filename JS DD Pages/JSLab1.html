<p> Here's a madlib about a kid named <span id = "name1">____</span>  who had an imaginary friend <span id = "name2"> ____</span>. One day the two of them went up a hill and found a pot of <span id = "noun1"> _____ </span>. They both had a craving for <span id = "noun2"> _____ </span>though. They live in an imaginary world called <span id = "noun3"> _____ </span>. One day they stumbled upon a <span id = "noun4"> _____ </span> and&nbsp; Elias strained his foot. Manuel said <span id = "dialogue1"> _____ </span> and proceeded to help Elias back up. Once he was&nbsp; on his feet, they headed out to their destination <span id = "noun5"> _____ </span> in hopes of finding <span id = "name3"> _____ </span>. He was an old friend who had once plowed the fields with them, and they were excited to catch up.</p>
