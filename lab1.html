    <H1> About myself </h1>
    

    <h2> Who am I? </h2>

    <p> My name is Engel Guzman and I am currently a 16 year old Junior at <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/schools/X324">BECA </A>living in the <a href="https://www.nycgo.com/boroughs-neighborhoods/the-bronx/">Bronx </A>, New York City. I was born in Dominican Republic, a place where the concept of seasons is virtually inexistant, as it is sunny, warm and humid all year long. I will be graduating high school by the year 2022 and by then, I hope to have a final decision on what colleges I will be attending. </p>

    <h2> My Junior Year </H2>

    <p> <a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-alert-ny?gclid=CjwKCAjwlID8BRAFEiwAnUoK1XnHrX4QdU0ukAzh-P0RRgLbEBA0shOniTXtfE9wDO8nv_cJqqwjaRoCdLAQAvD_BwE">Covid-19 </A> has altered the lives of just about everybody, including students who now have to attend school remotely. Thus far, my year has gotten off to a great start and I am beginning to be challenged in various ways in areas like math, technology as well as english and among others. This year I want to be as proactive as possible and I wish to do my best in everything I do this year. </p>

    <h2> Digital Design <a href="https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/sciences/design-technology/"> <img src="https://www.ibo.org/Assets/Images/logo-163.svg" width="81" height="22" </img> </a> </h2>

    <p> Digital Design is definetely one of my most challenging classes and what makes it the more challenging is the fact that on-site help from teachers is not as easy as it would normally be. This course is a <strong>STEM</strong> course and I've always struggled with subjects such as mathematics, coding, and science. This year, with the help of my teachers: Dr. O'Grady, Ms. Todres and Ms. Kollue, I hope to improve in these areas because even though it is not within my career interests, it is important to learn all the skills I learn nonetheless.</p>
