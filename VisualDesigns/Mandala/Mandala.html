	  <h2> Artist Statement </h2>
	
<p> My mandala was created using the shape of a boat. I chose to do this because I consider boats to be very appropriate for decoration and I thought that this same perspective would apply to a mandala. There are three primary colors in the mandala, brown, blue, neon yellow, and purple. Some of these colors such as blue and brown are merged while purple is solitary. This was the direction that I took because I believed it to be visually appealing. In order to turn this boat shape into a mandala, I first selected the shape and duplicated it three more times so that it would be a sort of compass. I then changed the colors of each of the four boats to be different  and proceeded to duplicate and rotate these four shapes until the end-result was the mandala on screen. </p>
