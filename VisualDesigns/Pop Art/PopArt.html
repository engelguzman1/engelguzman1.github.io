	  <h2> Artist statement </h2>
	  <p> I chose this portrait as opposed to the other two because I feel that it captures the essence of pop art better. I believe that this is due to the fact that there is a great contrast between the dark and light colors and the subject that is emphasized by the two colors that replaced these. While sloths may not be what comes to mind when we think of celebrities, I believe that animals are in fact celebrities as we pay them the same attention that we do to actual celebrities in our society. When an animal goes viral for a funny action or visual appeal, we circulate and consume media of them in it, effectively turning them into celebrities. I utilized pastel colors to contrast the light and dark elements of the portrait as I felt that stronger colors would overwhelm the eyes of the viewer. The first step of the project was to find an animal of choice and copy it over to Photoshop. Secondly, I duplicated the layer and cropped away any excess parts of the image in order to make the image clearer for subsequent steps. Next, with the threshold tool, I adjusted the contrast of the image so that the facial feature of the sloth would pop out more. Then, I merged the layers and picked colors for the image that would be kind to the eyes of the viewers. I repeated this process until I had achieved four different images in the four corners with distinct colors.
