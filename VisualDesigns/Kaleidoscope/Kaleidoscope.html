	  <h2> Artist Statement </h2>

	<p> I chose to base my kaleidoscope on any one thanksgiving table that I could find online. I chose this specific image because I thought that the vibrant red in the center would make for an excellent design. As for the filter, I chose this grainy, purplish filter as my goal was to create a very different image from the original which I believe that I achieved. I selected this one corner of the image because I thought that it captured a good shape centered in the middle of the image. With this in mind, the process consisted of selecting the image, applying a filter, adjusting it to only one corner of the image, and reflecting it in various directions until the result was the Kaleidoscope seen on screen.
