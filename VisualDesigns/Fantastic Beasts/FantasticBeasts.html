	  <h2> Artist Statement</h2>
	  
	  <p> For my Fantastic Beasts project I created a pair of hybrid beasts that would theoretically face each other. For the left-most creature, I went with a hybrid of a sloth representing its body and limbs, a cat for its head and pixie wings for its wings. The other creature is a hybrid of a monkeyâ€™s body and limbs, bird wings, and an elephant for its head. This mix of these animals are unrelated to each other, and it is this reason why I think that it is fitting. I wanted to include animal parts that we deemed as likable such as cats, elephants and sloths but I also wanted them to fly which is where the corresponding wings come from. Their abilities include flying, swinging from trees and vines as well as attacks with their respective limbs. The process to create these creatures was the following: I first searched for 3 animals that I wanted to create a hybrid of. Next, I copy and pasted these into photoshop and began removing any animal parts that I was not going to use so that I could then assemble these together to create the final product. Lastly, I searched and inserted a background that would represent a fitting setting for two beasts to face. I finally repeated this process for a second creature.
