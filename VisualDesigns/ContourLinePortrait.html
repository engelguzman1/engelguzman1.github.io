	  <h2> Artist Statement</h2>
	  <p> My picture of choice for this contour line portrait was a sloth. I specifically chose this picture of this particular animal because I thought that their face would make for a well-distinguished contour line portrait that could be discerned by anyone who glances at the piece. For the background, I included the line “Sloth the sloth”. I chose this text for the background of the image because I considered that its comical tone was fitting for what the portrait expresses in general. The process of turning this picture into a contour line portrait started with finding an image and importing it into the corresponding software. Afterwards, I got started with the contouring of the sloth’s face and when I finished, I applied an orange background that I thought would make a good contrast with the text that I was planning for. Finally, I inserted the text into the background, copy and pasted text until the entirety of the background was covered and changed its color to red.
