	<center> <p> Hello there! My name is Engel. I am from Dominican Republic, a country within the Caribbean and  currently reside in New York city as a High School senior at Bronx Early College Academy.
	Some of my interests include writing, reading, and playing video games. I love the outdoors, though unfortunately I don't get much of it living in New York City. That is why one of my favorite spots in the city is Central Park a place briming with nature where I often go to practice my photography, another one of my interests. Here is a pic I took in autumn:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
