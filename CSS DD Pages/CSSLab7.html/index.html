   <h3> Why Am I Interested in Making This Quiz? </h3>

    <p> I am intersted in making this quiz about Naruto because it is one of my favorite animes, and one that taught me about life. On the surface, Naruto may seem like a childish anime, but once you watch it, and connect with all the characters in the story, their own struggles teach important life lessons. This and much more make Naruto one of my favorite animes! </p>
