<h1> Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  </h1>

<h2> Early Life </h2>

<p> Ocasio-Cortez was born into a Catholic family in the Bronx borough of New York City on October 13, 1989, the daughter of Blanca Ocasio-Cortez (née Cortez) and Sergio Ocasio-Roman.[9] She has a younger brother named Gabriel.[10] Her father was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican family and became an architect; her mother was born in Puerto Rico.[11][12][13] Ocasio-Cortez lived with her family in an apartment in the Bronx neighborhood of Parkchester[12] until she was five, when the family moved to a house in suburban Yorktown Heights.[12][14] </p>

<p> Ocasio-Cortez attended Yorktown High School, graduating in 2007.[15] In high school and college, Ocasio-Cortez went by the name of "Sandy Ocasio".[16] She came in second in the microbiology category of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2007 with a research project on the effect of antioxidants on the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.[17][18] In a show of appreciation for her efforts, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory named a small asteroid after her: 23238 Ocasio-Cortez.[19][20] In high school, she took part in the National Hispanic Institute's Lorenzo de Zavala (LDZ) Youth Legislative Session. She later became the LDZ Secretary of State while she attended Boston University. Ocasio-Cortez had a John F. Lopez Fellowship.[21] </p>

<p> After graduating from high school, Ocasio-Cortez enrolled at Boston University. Her father died of lung cancer in 2008 during her second year,[22][23] and Ocasio-Cortez became involved in a lengthy probate battle to settle his estate. She has said that the experience helped her learn "first-hand how attorneys appointed by the court to administer an estate can enrich themselves at the expense of the families struggling to make sense of the bureaucracy."[24] During college, Ocasio-Cortez served as an intern for U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, in his section on foreign affairs and immigration issues.[25] She recalled, "I was the only Spanish speaker, and as a result, as basically a kid—a 19-, 20-year-old kid—whenever a frantic call would come into the office because someone is looking for their husband because they have been snatched off the street by ICE, I was the one that had to pick up that phone. I was the one that had to help that person navigate that system."[25] Ocasio-Cortez graduated cum laude[26] from Boston University in 2011 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in both international relations and economics.[27][28][21][29] </p>

<h2> 2018 Campaign </h2>

<p> Ocasio-Cortez began her campaign in April 2017[4] while waiting tables and tending bar at Flats Fix, a taqueria in New York City's Union Square.[40] "For 80 percent of this campaign, I operated out of a paper grocery bag hidden behind that bar," she told Bon Appétit.[41] She was the first person since 2004 to challenge Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair, in the primary. She faced a financial disadvantage, saying, "You can't really beat big money with more money. You have to beat them with a totally different game."[42][43][24] Ocasio-Cortez's campaign undertook grassroots mobilization and did not take donations from corporations.[4] Her campaign posters' designs were said to have taken inspiration from "revolutionary posters and visuals from the past."[44] </p>

<p> On June 15, the candidates' only face-to-face encounter during the campaign occurred on a local political talk show, Inside City Hall. The format was a joint interview conducted by Errol Louis, which NY1 characterized as a debate.[45] On June 18, a debate in the Bronx was scheduled, but Crowley did not participate. He sent former New York City Council member Annabel Palma in his place.[46][47][48] </p>
