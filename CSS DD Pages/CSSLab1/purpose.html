      <h1 style="color:#F1C40F;">My Purpose <img src="../../Images/SmallPicture.png" alt="The Ancient Magus' Bride Icon" width="40" height="40" </h1>

         <h4 style="color:#201772 ;"> <p> For this project I chose to base it on The Ancient Magus's Bride because ever since I discovered it, I was fascinated by every aspect of this series. The characters, magic tehniques, soundtracks and the visual elements of the anime drew me to such extend that I even purchased its novels and I plan to read the manga. </p>

        <p> I recommend it to anyone who likes magic and folklore while also having wholesome characters with an elaborate and resilient background story. </p> </h4>
